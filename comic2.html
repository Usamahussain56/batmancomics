						            		<p>The graphic novel that started the modern age of Batman, and of comics in general too. Hugely influential, its a landmark piece of work which was an instant classic. Lets take a look at Frank Miller's story and art, and see just what makes this work so great, and how it elevated Batman to another level.</p>

												<h4>Plot Synopsis</h4>
												
											</div>
											
													<p class="time">
														by <a href="#"> blindSpace</a>
													</p>
												</div>
											</div>
											<p>  The story opens with Jim Gordon and Bruce Wayne reminicing about the old days. The conversation heavily implies that Gordon knew that Bruce Wayne was Batman all along. It is also stated that Bruce hasn't been in touch with Dick Grayson after the death of Jason Todd (the second robin). Bruce Wayne has been feeling incomplete ever since he retired as Batman ten years ago.

												Crime in Gotham is rising, and Bruce hears the inner monologue of Batman tormenting him more and more, urging Bruce to bring out Batman again. Batman is finally out there in Gotham again, initially roughing up petty criminals, which was enough to cause chatter in the city of him returning. Harvey Dent has his full face restored and is thought by the public to be normal again. However, he has still not recovered, and holds the city ransom for five million dollars, or else he will blow the twin towers of Gotham up. Batman manages to subdue him, and finds out for sure that even though Harvey's face is fixed, his mind is still a monster inside.
												
												Deep down inside, Bruce realises that it is somewhat of the same situation with him. Batman retired and stayed out of action for ten years, but his mind would never rid himself of the Batman. He will always be there.
												
												Gordon gets attacked by a young member of the Mutant Gang, and is promptly handled and killed in the process by Gordon. The leader of the mutant gang vows revenge on him, as well as on Batman. There is talk on who will replace Gordon once he retires soon. Meanwhile, a group (the council of mothers) asked the city to arrest Batman - citing him as a bad influence on young children, while another group (the victim's rights task force) asked the city to sanction Batman's activities. Meanwhile, Batman saves a teenage girl called Carrie Kelly, who later buys a robin costume and begins training as Robin on her own, in secret.
												
												It is announced that Ellen Yindel, a woman half of Gordon's age, and a cop from Chicago, would be brought to Gotham City to replace Gordon as commisioner of Gotham City. Meanwhile, Batman makes it to the leader of the Mutant gang (robin following him secretly). Batman intimidates the gang with his Bat-mobile, but steps out of the vehicle to fight the mutant gang leader hand-to-hand, as a means of testing himself. He decisively gets beaten by the mutant, and is helped out at the last moment by Carrie Kelly and Batman escapes.
												
												Superman by now is a tool of the U.S. Government, with all the other superheroes returning to their places of origins, or retiring altogether. It seemed like Batman had too, until now - In the White House, the president of the United States (modelled after the erstwhile president Ronald Reagan), asks Superman to issue a warning to Batman to stop his activities. It's assume that the president knows that Batman can never be controlled by him the same way Superman has been, so it is essential to get rid of him.
												
												The Joker has been dormant for a decade (ever since Batman retired). Now that Batman is active again, he returns from comatosis, and has a renewed sense of purpose, plans to return to his psychotic ways. He tries to manipulate people into bringing him on a TV show. Meanwhile, the mayor of Gotham decided to negotiate with the leader of the mutant gang. The mutant ends up murdering him brutally.
												
												Bruce, much to the chagrin of Alfred, is very enthusiastic about Carrie Kelly being the next Gotham. Alfred reminds him of Jason Todd's death, but Bruce is unwilling to change his mind. Batman asks Gordon to help him out one last time before he retires, by allowing Batman to help the mutant gang leader escape. When he does, Batman engages with him in a fight in a mudpit.
												
												This time Batman engages in a different strategy to defeat the gang leader. Previously, he was trying to match him in strength and agility, which Batman was no match for. This time, he took his time, timed and placed with attacks with surgical precision, and defeated him handily. He wanted to do this in front of all the gan leaders, in order to humiliate them and break their spirit.
												
												Gordon retires, and replacement Ellen Yindel becomes the new GCPD Police Commisioner. Her first directive is to issue an arrest warrant for Batman, and the police start searching for him. Meanwhile the Joker goes on the tv show, gasses the entire set, killing everyone there. Next he forces Selina Kyle to ask an escort to kill a congressman. Batman questions her, and selina tells her about Joker's plan to murder at the county fair, and another plan to kill the governor. Ellen Yindel follows him, but Batman escapes, but asks Yindel to save the governor, as his life is in danger.
